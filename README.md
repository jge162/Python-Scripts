**Scripts to help you get through your day faster.**

# Initial setup:

# Open terminal 

type: 

`crontab -e`

`0 0 * * * sudo python3 /Users/home/Scripts/Master_script.py`

In nano, you can press `Ctrl + O` to save the file and then press Enter. To exit, press `Ctrl + X`.

In vim, you can type `:w` and press Enter to save the file, and then type `:q` and press Enter to exit.

`crontab -l`

Your Python script will now run daily at 12:00 AM as scheduled by the cron job. Make sure that the script has executable permissions, and it should work as expected. If your script requires root (sudo) privileges, you should ensure that it's safe to run with those privileges, as running scripts with elevated permissions can be risky.


After downloading the repo, open the zip folder and use your
prefered IDE. I personally used [PyCharm.](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/#section=mac) 

After that you need to find the file path for you 
folder and update it **Accordingly.**

# Supported systems:

Also note: Codes are setup to run on `Mac OSX (supported_system != PC || Linux)`

# Time to run the scripts:

Lastly, you can open a terminal window on your Mac and run `sudo python3 Master_Script.py`

Or alternatively, you can just run `python3 Master_script.py` to execute all desired scripts in one 
command line entry in terminal PyCharm too.
